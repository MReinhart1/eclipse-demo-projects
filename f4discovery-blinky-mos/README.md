# Blinky demo for STM32F4DISCOVERY, using µOS++

This demo program blinks the 4 coloured LEDs on the STM32F4DISCOVERY.

It demonstrates:

- how to organise a project using the content of several xpacks, including the µOS++ IIIe / CMSIS++ code
- how to integrate CubeMX initialisation code

Until the XCDL utility will be available, the `xpacks` folder is generated with `scripts/update-xpacks.sh`.
